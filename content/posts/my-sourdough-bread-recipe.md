# How I Make Sourdough Bread

## Ingredients:

* 420g strong bread flour
* 80g wholemeal wheat flour
* 335g water at 40 degrees celcius
* 150g levain
* 11g salt

## Mixing the ingredient

Mix 300g of the water with both flours. Mix until it becomes a more homogeneous ball and leave it to rest for 35 minutes. This is the autolyse.

On another container mix the other 35g of water with the salt and once autolyse is done add it to the dough as well as the levain. Mix them all well until all is absorbed by the dough and it feel homogeneous as a dough ball.
Once that's done leave the dough to rest for 30 minutes.

## Stretch and fold

After 30 minutes do the first round (out of 6) of streching and folding of the dough. This will create gluten and the nice air pockets you'll later on enjoy on the bread.
Do each round of stretching every 30 minutes.

## Shaping

30 minutes after the last folding put the dough in the counter and start shaping it, creating tension on the gluten at the top of the dough. Don't over do it! Once the ball seems right leave it resting in the counter for 20 minutes. It should spread a bit but not too much.

Once that's done turn it around and do the final shaping, folding it over itself to create a boule shape. Once folded do a bit more of shaping to assure the tension on the dough and put it in the proofing basket once you're happy with it. 

Put it in the fridge and leave it overnight (7 hours) to bake first thing in the morning.

## Baking

Pre-heat the oven at 260 degrees celcius - put your ironcast pot in the oven and leave it to heat for 30 minutes. Once ready, put the dough in the pot and score it. Put it in the oven for 20 minutes for the spring oven.

After that, take off the lid of the pot and lower the oven temperature to 230 degrees. Leave the bread in for 25 minutes more or as much as it works for you to get it to a nice brown tone.
